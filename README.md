This is a functional retail website that allows the user to create an inventory of video games for a ficticious video game retail shop.
Additionally, the user is allowed to add developers and platforms, in addition to games.  Custom searches allow the user to find games
with ease.  The game properties can be changed with an edit button.  The admin is the only user allowed to make these changes using Spring 
Security.
